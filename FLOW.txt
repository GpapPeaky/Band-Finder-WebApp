USER:
    MODE 2 Private event requests:  
        When clicking at an available spot we send a request immidiately
        and then whatever happens
            
    MODE 3 Private event messaging:
        User can only see private events that where requested
        by them 
        on the left there will be the private events that the user
        requested, clicking in it, will show on the right the 
        message board between the user and the band that the request
        was given to.

BAND:
    The band can organise their private/public events:

        -Accept/decline requests from users
        -Create public events
        -Set availabilities for users to query for other requests

    They can answer to user's messages, same UI as the user
    but instead of band_name to the left, it will have the user's name

    A page for band info, links etc as well
    as display for band's public events and reviews.
